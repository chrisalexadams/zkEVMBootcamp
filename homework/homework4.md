# Homework 4

## Some modular arithmetic

1. **Working with the following set of integers `S` = `{0,1,2,3,4,5,6}`**

    - What is 4 + 4 ?

        `answer: 1` - `S` has 7 elements, thus `8 mod 7 = 1`
    - What is 3 x 5 ?

        `answer: 1` - `15 mod 7 = 1`

    - What is the inverse of 3 under
      - additon?

        `answer: 4`
      - multiplication?

        `answer: 1`

2. **For `S` = `{0,1,2,3,4,5,6}`**

    - Can we consider `S` and the operation `+` to be a group?

3. **What is `-13 mod 5`?**

    `answer: 2`

4. **Polynomials**

    - For the polynomial $x^3-x^2+4x-12$
      - Find a positive root
  
         `answer: 3`
      - What is the degree of this polynomial?

        `answer: 2`
